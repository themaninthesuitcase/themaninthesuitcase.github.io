I was curious what the seemingly overly complex bundle of wire was doing in my PRS SE Standard 24, so with the help of [DIY Layout Creator][diylc] I drew out the wiring to figure it out.

I also had to work out what the colour codes are on the G&B manufactured 85/15S pickups used.  After looking at how the pickups were wired up it seems they shared the same layout as DiMarzio pickups.

The push pull pot works to split the coils.  When the knob is down then you get both humbuckers.

When the knob is pulled up, it removes one of the coils so you only get one of them.  What is clever is you get one of each polarity so in the middle you retain the hum cancelling.

The Bridge is a reasonably standard layout where the 2nd coil in the path is grounded, leaving the North polarised slug coil. On the neck pickup the wiring is a little different, and it cuts the first coil out of the circuit and swaps to use the middle link as the new "hot" connection. This means you're using the South polarised screw coil.

This is great as it means you get to keep hum cancelling when you use the middle position, as you still have both halves of a humbucker, just a bit further apart than normal and in parallel rather than series.
