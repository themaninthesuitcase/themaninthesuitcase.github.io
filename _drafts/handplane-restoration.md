One of the tools commonly used for wood working is the handplane.  These come in a variety of sizes from only a few inches long to 60cm monsters weighing several kilos.  Their purpose is to level and straighten wood and prepare it for jointing.  It's generally thought that some of the best are actually old vintage models made by Stanley or Bailey.  These are readily available used and usually have plenty of life left in them. Once you clean them up that is.

{BEFORE IMAGES FROM GARAGE}

This was my Dads plane.  It's a Stanley number 4, which is a middle size and a very handy one to have.  It also had seen better days.  The rear handle (called the tote) was broken, the metal work was all very rusted and the finish on the handles was flaking badly.  It was time to restore it for use in some projects I have in mind in future.

The first thing I did was to date the plane.  There's no specific reason for this but I felt it wise just in case this was older or rarer than I suspected it was.  Using an [online tool][planeage] I was able to age the plane to be a type 19 from 1948-1961.  This ties in roughly to when my dad most likely would have bought it.  

It's worth noting at this point none of this was being done blind.  This is a very common thing to do so there are lots of vidoes on YouTube.  I mainly used 2: One by [Rag and Bone Brown][rabb], and another by [Paul Sellers][ps].  Though these were far from the only ones I watched.

{PARTS BOX}

The restore began by taking the whole thing apart. This only needs a single large flate blade screw driver and doesn't take long. It was at this point I realised the tote was actually glued out of alignement.  This made removing it very tricky as it was pinching the threaded rod.  A bit of brute force eventually got it free with minimal damage to the wood.  

{BROKEN HANDLE}

To do the job as best as I could I decided to re-break the handle at the glue join.  Fortuatley the glue wasn't very good and simply sliding in a pallette knife returned it to two pieces.  The glue was cleaned up as bes as I could with a combination of Isopropyl Alcohol, Acetone [^handplane1] and a wire brush.  I wanted to avoid sanding to try and keep as much of the wood as possible.  To re-assemble the tote I decided to use expoxy rather than wood glue.  This was due to the break not lining up as well as I'd like so expoxy would fill any gaps well but remain strong over time.  After a few dry runs I mixed up some 5 minute epoxy, clamped up the handle and left it over night to cure.

[^handplane1]: Not a mix, seperate aplications to try removing the glue. Probably also worth noting these melted the finish a little which made removing it later a bit harder as it was no longer flakey.
