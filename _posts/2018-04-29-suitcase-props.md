So, I've been selling a few 3D printed prop parts on [Shapeways][shapwaysstore] since Rogue One was released in 2016.  The store was named Suitcase Props, a play on my long time screen name.

What I never did though, was any branding at all.  Being named after luggage didn't give me any instant ideas and so I left it.  I did think about recruiting a proper designer or maybe asking a friend to help but I just didn't have any ideas for a long time.

Recently however, I had a bit of inspiration and spent some time in [Inkscape][inkscape] iterating on the design.

<img class="padded center"
		alt="Suitcase Props logo"
		src="/images/2018-04-29-suitcase-props/SP-Props-Logo.png"
	  srcset="/images/2018-04-29-suitcase-props/SP-Props-Logo.png 1x, /images/2018-04-29-suitcase-props/SP-Props-Logo-x2.png 2x" />

The end result is a simplified suitcase, I'd found more realistic ones never worked in the past.  The wordmark was the result of some time hunting on [dafont][dafont] for a futuristic font.  I took this and then joined the S and P to give a more stylised look.

<img class="padded center"
		alt="Suitcase Props logo - icon style"
		src="/images/2018-04-29-suitcase-props/SP-Props-Icon.png"
	  srcset="/images/2018-04-29-suitcase-props/SP-Props-Icon.png 1x, /images/2018-04-29-suitcase-props/SP-Props-Icon-x2.png 2x" />

For times when the full logo is a bit much or I want something small I also created an icon styled logo isolating just the wordmark.
