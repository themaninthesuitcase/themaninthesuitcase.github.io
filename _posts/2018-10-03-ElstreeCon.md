At the weekend I was lucky enough to be able to return once again to where it all started: Elstree Studios in Borehamwood just 11 miles from home.

This was a troop at ElstreeCon 2.0 in aid of [The National Autism Society][nas].  Whilst small this was an enjoyable event with a few actors and actresses in attendance.  

In the afternoon we were lucky enough to be escorted onto the studio lot, past active sets, to the George Lucas Stage for a few photos!
