On Friday we went to [London Film and Comic Con][lfcc] to meet a few actors and add to our collection signatures.

Number one on my list was Lucius Malfoy aka [Jason Issacs][jiimdb].  After a bit, okay lot, of queuing we got to have a nice little chat with Jason who signed a Lucius Mask for me and also told me a brief story about the mask.

I've spent a lot of time on these masks: but there was no mask on set.  For the 11 seconds the mask was on screen it was all CG!  Jason was directed to just wave the mask away and "there will be a mask there or something" "theyâ€™ll make it work".  Which to be fair, they did and it was good enough to capture my imagination.

There are some beautiful hand made pewter Deatheater masks in the studio tour, which is what this one is trying to replicate.  All I can assume is they were made and just not used on set, maybe used to help with the CG.

I've been meaning to write a post on how I made these masks.  It's rather involved so I keep putting it off, but I will do it soon.
