Yesterday I took the day off to take the girls to [ZSL Whipsnade Zoo][zslWhipsnade]. Of all the exotics that are on show the one that really took my interest was the Slivery Marmoset.

These small monkeys from Brazil are allowed to run free in the day so can be seen really well sat on top of their enclosure.

[Also on 500px][500px], please have a look.
