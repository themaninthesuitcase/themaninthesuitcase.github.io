I hate to say it but [#mykewasright][mwr].

Ever since Apple announced the iPhone 6 Plus back in 2014 I've been saying it's too big and I'd never buy one.  But here I am with a 6S Plus and I love it.

Okay, this is old news now.  The plus sized phone is 18 months old and now in to it's S generation. But like many normal people I'm on a 24 month upgrade cycle and have only just managed to upgrade.

I'll spare the world yet another review but offer this: try it, you might just like it.  The battery life is great[^plus1] and the extra screen space works well in so many apps.

*One more thing*, I have always been a big fan of Apple's leather cases and have them, in black, for both my 5S, iPad Air 2 and now my 6S Plus.  On the older two the leather was soft and grippy out of the box.  However on this new 6S Plus case the leather is harder and less grippy.  My wife went with the silicone case and having tried hers I think I went with the wrong case.  A [Â£40 mistake][applecase] that I will just have to live with for a while, Apple cases aren't cheap.

[^plus1]: I'm getting 2 whole days and overnight at the moment, but now I'm back at work I am expecting GPS use to butcher that.
