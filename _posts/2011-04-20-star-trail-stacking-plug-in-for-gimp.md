I have tried to make this as simple as possible to use with only 4 options to set.

This is a work in progress and I hope to make this easier to use and more powerful as time passes.

You can get the plug-in from Google code: <a href="http://code.google.com/p/gimp-startrail-compositor">http://code.google.com/p/gimp-startrail-compositor</a>

<strong>Update: </strong>About the time I released this some new multiplatform was released called starstax <a href="http://www.markus-enzweiler.de/software/software.html">http://www.markus-enzweiler.de/software/software.html</a>.

After first looks this looks pretty good and it seems to give good results.  This will be something I will test out further next time I do some trails.
