I have spent a few evenings working on a new plug-in for creating star trails in GIMP.  When asking about stacking star trails the common answer seems to be use [startrails.de].  This is great until you don't run windows.  The other option is a Photoshop action floating about the web.  But this means Photoshop and my trial is about to run out.  So decided to write a plug-in for the gimp that does what the other 2 pieces of software do.

I have tried to make this as simple as possible to use with only 4 options to set.

This is a work in progress and I hope to make this easier to use and more powerful as time passes.

You can get the plug-in from [Github][gimp-startrail-compositor]

## Update
About the time I released this some new multiplatform software was released called [Starstax].

After first looks this looks pretty good and it seems to give good results.  This will be something I will test out further next time I do some trails.
