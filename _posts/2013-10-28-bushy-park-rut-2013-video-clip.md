title: "Bushy Park Rut 2013 - Video Clip"
---
I have made a short clip of the rut in Bushy Park from the other week. This is my first effort with video, there's so much to learn!  The sound is probably the biggest issue but I would need an external mic to do any better really.

Pretty happy with the quality from the D7000 and I edited in the new iMovie.  Whilst this doesn't offer buckets of control there's enough there to string a few clips together and to adjust the exposure down a touch.  The interface is much cleaner than the last version of iMovie and I now find it usable.  Some of the pre planned effects and transitions are a bit cheesy so I've tried to stick to fairly simple fades and clean titles.
