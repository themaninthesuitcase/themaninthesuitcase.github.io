The other week we went down to visit my Dad for lunch as we often do.  After lunch, we decided to pop over to [Andertons Music Co][andertons] for a look for something for Middlest&trade; to earn as a reward over the next few weeks/months.

She's been showing interest in guitar so we picked out a few Squiers and Epiphones for her to look at.  She liked a pink [Squier 3/4 Strat][andertsonsPinkSquier] but ultimately picked a turquoise [Epiphone Les Paul SL][andertonsLPSL].

I was about to put the guitar back on the rack and give her the whole speil about she could have one once she'd earned it when "I can play a D chord"....

Sure enough she did, which was rather surprising as I didn't teach her and I wasn't sure what was going on. Turned out she's been using her sisters guitar and watching [JustinGuitar][justinguitar].

I submit the following as evidence of the D chord.

The guitar came home with us that day. The story doesn't end there though.

Andertons run a competition called [#AndertonsMadeMeDoIt][andertonscomps], which is a post your purchases with a hashtag social media competition.  So a week later I put a [post up on Instagram][instagrampost] not expecting more than a few likes just like past entries.  The staff at Andertons left a lovely comment, [Danish Pete][instadp] liked the post and so I was happy.

Well on July 1st at about lunch-time a notification pops up saying Andertons had followed me on Instagram, that's weird why would they do that? A few minutes later revealed why: we'd won the June draw!  A nice shiny new [Boss Katana 50][andertonskat50] and a T-shirt, I chose small for the Middlest to wear.

Yesterday evening the man in brown arrived during dinner and dropped of the prizes.

Middlest was super excited and put the T-shirt straight on. They are really nice quality so I may have to try get myself one next time we are in the store.

We all (Middlest, Eldest and myself) took a few turns on the amp just fiddling with the panel controls.  After they were all in bed I updated the firmware on the amp[^andertonsmademe1] and had a play with the Tone Studio on my laptop.  

This amp is incredibly versatile, loads of sounds are in there I am sure once I figure out what all the buttons, knobs and sliders do.  The headphone out is a lot nicer than the one on the Blackstar Core:id we also have.

So thank you very much to the team at Andertons, you've made 3 people very happy.  Though next door may be somewhat less happy, it's pretty loud.

ps: I still want a [Vox AC15 though...][andertonsAC15]

[^andertonsmademe1]: You have to wonder what the designers of valve amps in the 50's and 60's would make of software updates to amplifiers...
