Listening to a podcast today I noticed something.  Halfway through a sentence a guest stopped to point out that the product was made in the US. You can listen to the episode of The Pen Addict at the right point [here][tpa].

It occurred to me that this doesn't happen here.  You almost never hear some one say that some product they bought was UK made. In fact on the few occasions it is mentioned it's usually to point out how poorly made something is. See [The IT Crowd][itc].
