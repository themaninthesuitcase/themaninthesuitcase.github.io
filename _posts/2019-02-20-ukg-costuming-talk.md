It's a bit late but last November whilst trooping at [MCM Comicon Birmigham][mcmb] I took part in a costuming talk on one of the small stages.  

The talk was presented by UKG Commanding officer Gary Hailes and covers an assortment of Star Wars costumes as well as a few from other films.

I'm the Stormtrooper who is up first.

Just a small insight into some of the detail and effort that goes into the costumes we build for both the [501st Legion][501st] and [Reel Icons][ri].
