<p style="text-align: left;">Every year RHS Wisley gardens hosts a butterfly event in their fantastic glass house. Â This runs from mid January to the end of February, and there's usually a queue to get in.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">This is an Owl Butterfly which was on a nice rusted piece of garden furniture.</p>
