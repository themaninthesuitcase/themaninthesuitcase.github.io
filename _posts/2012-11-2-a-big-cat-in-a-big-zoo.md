I had the opportunity to visit Marwell Wildlife in Hampsire this week.  As this was primarily a family trip I didn't come home with a huge number of images but there was 1 I am very happy with.  A Snow Leopard!

<!--more-->I first encountered the Marwell snow leopards at about 11 months old on a boxing day visit.  Due to the low volumes of visitors it was that day the keepers decided to allow their new snow leopard cubs out for the first time.  I was apparently enthralled with these small killing machines and some thing about them even now still draws me to them over any of the other big cats. I could have spent far longer watching these than we did.

This image took a bit of trying to get as the glass we filthy.  Once I had discovered a clear bit it was simply a case of waiting for the cat to look the right way.  My 1 regret is I was a touch loose with the zoom which meant a small crop in post.  I would like this printed one day (along with my <a title="Silvery Marmoset" href="http://www.cpearson.me.uk/2012/08/silvery-marmoset/" target="_blank">silvery marmoset</a>) and this small crop will cost me in print quality.  I long for more than my meagre 6 megapixels, this crop only giving me 4.6 of them left.  Hopefully with a small amount of interpolating I'll get away with a nice 10x12".

If you wish to see the full gallery of images from the day then these are currently on my flickr page: <a title="Flickr Marwell Set" href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/themaninthesuitcase/sets/72157631913862550/" target="_blank">http://www.flickr.com/photos/themaninthesuitcase/sets/72157631913862550/</a>
