One of my goals for 2018 is to get back into my photography.  For assorted reasons, I've not really used my DSLR kit for about 2.5-3 years now.  The last serious use was when I went to Skomer in Wales to photograph puffins in 2015.  I'll try and write a short post on that in the near future.

As part of the process of re-educating myself about my past journey I have re-loaded all my old posts from my previous [Wordpress][wordpress] blog and updated all the images and links to work again.  I did do some minor spellchecking, grammar edits and removed some dead links, but for the most part these are all as written.

If you want to read the posts either head to the [Archive](/archive/) or the first post is a review of the [Optech sling strap][firstpost].
