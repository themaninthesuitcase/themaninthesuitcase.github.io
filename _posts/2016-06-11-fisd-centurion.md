Within the First Imperial Stormtrooper Detachment (FISD) there are 3 levels of approval:

 1. Basic approval
 1. Expert Infantry Battalion
 1. Centurion

With the increase of each level from 1&ndash;3 higher emphasis is placed on the accuracy of the armour to the film used originals.

I passed my level 2: EIB on 7th May 2016 and yesterday, on 10th June 2016, I passed my Centurion approval.

I am especially proud of this because the staff go out of their way to find a nitpick but I was passed with out comment.  This is pretty rare so I am really happy with this.

Now to carry this success forward with further costumes. I've already started work on my next, a TIE pilot from A New Hope.
