It started with a brief twitter conversation about writing a blog and developing in the newest hip language that the cooler kids where using.  [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) if you're interested, I can tell you are.  After a brief exchange I resolved to write my own blog engine.

It was called [Hex](https://github.com/themaninthesuitcase/hex) and it even rendered out posts.  Then I had to index the posts from disk and decided to try object oriented JavaScript which is when it all went wrong, <code>this</code> I hate you. Combine this with my then 12 month old twins discovering how their legs worked and the project was canned.

Fast forward 5 months and I am ready to give things a second go.  However as the title suggests I bottled it.  Rather than home rolling my own engine I've used [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com).  I went with this option as it's simple but I remain in control. It also allows me to use [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com) as my host for free and so saves me Â£3 a month.  Maybe I'll finally get [backblaze](https://www.backblaze.com) with the money.

So here we are, I've done it. Maybe people will read this, maybe they won't. I'll never know as I've not added analytics to this page.  This is about the journey.
