As I mentioned in a [previous post][altag] I've been working on a voice changer app to use with the Storm Trooper armour kit I've ordered.  Well last night the prospect of this becoming a reality came one step closer.

I registered as an Apple developer.

Now this may not sound like a big deal but it was a Â£79 expense, so not throw away money.  Especially as I have no expectation of earning this back.

This is something I've wanted to be able to do for a while so it's pretty exciting. Whilst this is never going to be good enough to justify a trip to [WWDC] maybe I might be able to look into future development opportunities like the [Apple TV dev kits][atvdk] after this years' conference.
