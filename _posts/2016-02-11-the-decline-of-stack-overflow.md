Source: [The decline of Stack Overflow][decline]

I've been a member on Stack Overflow [for over 6 years][soprofile].  In the early days it was a great site and full of helpful people trying to help.

More recently I find myself agreeing more and more with John. The feel of the site has lost what made it great in the early days, the oppressive feeling is very apparent and I now hesitate to participate.

I don't claim to have an answer for these problems but maybe it's time for _The Next Big Thing&trade;_.
