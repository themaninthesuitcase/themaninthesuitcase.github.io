One of the many fallow deer stags that stalks Bushy Park in Surrey.  This was taken during the rut (deer mating season) which usually kicks off in September and lasts 1-3 months.

The deer get most active at dawn and sunset, meaning low light.  However this can give some nice silhouette shots like this one.
