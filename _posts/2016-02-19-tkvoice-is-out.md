After a much longer gestation than I thought[^1] TKVoice is now available on the App Store.

<a href="https://geo.itunes.apple.com/gb/app/tkvoice/id1079598806?mt=8&at=1000l88V&ct=website"><img class="center" src="/images/tkvoice/appstorebadge.svg" alt="Download on the App Store" /></a>

TKvoice allows Troopers to achieve a film like sound when trooping.  It will automatically detect your voice, apply effects and even give a static burst at the end of your sentence!

In order to troop, as well as TKVoice you will require a microphone, speaker and a splitter cable though you can test it out with just the headset that came with your phone.  Further details on compatible hardware will be added to the [tkvoice][tkv] section of the site over then coming days.

This isn't the end of the road and I already have several improvements planned based on feedback from beta testers.

I hope you try this out as a more affordable alternative to other hardware units.  I look forward to hearing from users.
