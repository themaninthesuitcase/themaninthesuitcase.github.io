Listening to a podcast today I noticed something.  Half way through a sentence a guest stopped to point out that the product was made in the US. You can listen to the episode of The Pen Addict at the right point [here][tpa].

It occurred to me that this doesn't happen here.  You almost never hear some one say that some product they bought was UK made. In fact on the few occasions it is pointed out it's usually to point out how poorly made something is. See [The IT Crowd][itc].

I wonder if this attitude is as as result of the decline of British manufacturing or the cause of it.
