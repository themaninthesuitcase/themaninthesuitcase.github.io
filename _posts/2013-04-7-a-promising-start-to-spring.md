I spent another evening over at the reserve this evening.  It would seem I am starting to get the hang of this wildlife thing as I not only found a single female deer almost straight away I also managed to get with in a sensible range, about 30m, without drawing attention or alerting her.

Here she was joined by the single buck I've seen recently with the lop sided antlers.

<p style="text-align: left;">He seemed to be aware of my presence and stood guard over his female.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Eventually both the deer began to drift to the back of the field and behind the shrubs out of sight so I called it a day.</p>
