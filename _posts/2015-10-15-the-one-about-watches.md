I've had my watch for a long time.  I can't remember exactly when I got it but it was bought using money I was given by my grandmother,  I'd estimate I've had it about 12 years. It's made by the respected Swiss brand Tissot and I've worn it more or less every day since I bought it.

But in April 2014 Apple changed everything. Watching the announcement of Apple Watch my interest was piqued. Something I've not been able to shake since.

We are now 6 months after its release and I find my self rationalising a purchase at least once a week.  Occasionally I handle one in my local Apple Store and twirl the Digital Crown or try a force touch.

I listen to a lot of Apple centric podcasts ([ATP](http://atp.fm), [Connected](http://www.relay.fm/connected), [Analog(ue)](http://www.relay.fm/analogue), [The Talk Show](http://daringfireball.net/thetalkshow/)) where they talk about the watch on a reasonably regular basis. Whilst they all love their Apple Watch in varying amounts, none of them seem to make the case that this is a must have device like the smartphone has become.

The problem seems to boil down to the 3rd party apps aren't really very good which reduces the watch to a glorified fitness band with notifications. Whilst the consensus seems to be that the notifications and fitness is great I'm not 100% sold that they are going to change my life.

Ultimately this comes down to a choice. Do I get an Apple Watch or do I stay with my Tissot, or another analogue watch for that matter. The choice is further complicated by the fact there is no one Apple Watch to pick from.  In an ideal world I'd be picking up a stainless steel Apple Watch with the link bracelet tomorrow. However costing more than an 13" MacBook Air[^watch1] I cannot in any good conscience buy one.

This leaves the sport, and I don't think that is the watch I want.

[^watch1]: As of writing the 11" MacBook Air starts at £749, the 13" starts at £849. The Apple Watch of choice is a 42mm stainless steel with the link bracket at £859.
