Welcome. I'm Chris Pearson, a husband, father and nerd living in the UK.

By day I work as a software programmer using Microsoft .NET technologies. By night I am a maker, cosplayer/costumer, LEGO enthusiast and mediocre sci-fi and film nerd.

In 2016 I became a member of the UK Garrison and 501st Legion as a Stormtrooper.  As part of the UK Garrison I now use my trooper to help raise money for charity and bring enjoyment to fans old and young.
